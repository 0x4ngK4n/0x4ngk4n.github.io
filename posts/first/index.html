        <p><del>A little</del> About me&hellip;<br>
<br>
I am Angkan and as of today, I have been in IT for about 14 years now.<br>
<br>
Back when I started, I was doing tech support for firewalls which, while I didn&rsquo;t enjoy much but got me hooked into how computers communicate. Fast forward few job hoops where I acquired skills such as scripting and nix fundamentals, I landed a role where I gained exposure to first hand cyber-attacks employed by attackers-in-the-wild. This was 10 years back from today. Attacks were mostly around lack of input validation, source to sink based, deterministic in nature and like many before me and after, I was also like <strong>wow ^~^</strong> would be cool to be a hacker-at-work.<br>
<br>
Consulting was mostly nice as I got to work on web, mobile apps as well as thick clients. Most importantly, what I learnt was how to document the findings to <strong>pro</strong>fessionally relay to the clients. More often than not, this is a really important part of overall project delivery. Then from a general web app consultant, I landed roles as a red teamer and maldev where I got to work with some of the very best in the industry while actually executing entire cyber kill chains. <strong>THIS WAS FUN!</strong><br>
<br>
However, while maldev <del>was</del>is cool and I really love<del>d</del> red teaming, what always had got me excited was initial access. Specially zero or 1 click exploits. With some experience over the years and being a generalist in various domains in cyber-sec, I thought it was high time I specialise in one skill set and be really excellent at that.<br>
<br>
Especially with advent and improvements around AI, where we are at the cusp of interfacing with computers just with human language (<em>yet another higher level abstraction over high level computer languages</em>), not a better time to get closer to the machine and hardware to keep that professional edge.<br>
<br>
This blog will detail my journey towards an N-day researcher. It won&rsquo;t just start with N-days but more like, revising and learning new concepts around binary exploitation, getting hands dirty on wargames, CTFs and finally to N-day CVE analysis and crafting PoCs but most importanly documenting my thought process.<br>
<br>
Lets go!</p>
